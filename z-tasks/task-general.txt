1)remove this:
MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 muirtl-deep-s0pvr6
with lazy load it gives inaccurate facts
3)scan mui docs for better qty buttons, keep + [    ] - where manual number can be insterted. (createSvgIcon,double-digit centered Basic TextField)

5) make sure admin,verified members see prices 
show within accordion header after english name product info (Dividers)

6) after refresh the admin become regular user and it stop loading it says accordion catalog with error שגיאה בטעינת מוצרים: החיבור איטי מדי - אנא נסה שוב
please scan react docs/mui docs for this common problem. i think it happens when logging in. it always happen to me with you. its a repeating problem



MAIN PAGE LAYOUT
-move the jean darcel to top center with logo. make it uploaded in admin.(its  near search now) - no logo on mobile
-main menu ( catalog order form management) make it in the center under logo. managment panel link in blue line.
-all buttons rtl symbol and text's order and spacing are fucked up. look for material ui docs


2) order form after sumbit
-too many rows, looks not nice make it look like in print layout.


3) catalog
-instead showing category (skin type) show short description


i see now prices db i am not very unsatisfied. it has too many column, price tier is constant(verified members+admin), currency(ILS) is also constant so no need these extra data, product ref can be the id as well, please make sql for the editor. and edit code
