1)remove this:
MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 muirtl-deep-s0pvr6
with lazy load it gives inaccurate facts
2) make filter permanent in desktop view(no need to click)
3)scan mui docs for better qty buttons, keep + [    ] - where manual number can be insterted. (createSvgIcon,double-digit centered Basic TextField)
4)remove <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body2 muirtl-deep-s0pvr6">Sign in to view prices</p> no need to alert them to sign in
5) make sure admin,verified members see prices 
show within accordion header after english name product info (Dividers)

6) after refresh the admin become regular user and it stop loading it says accordion catalog with error שגיאה בטעינת מוצרים: החיבור איטי מדי - אנא נסה שוב
please scan react docs/mui docs for this common problem. i think it happens when logging in. it always happen to me with you. its a repeating problem
