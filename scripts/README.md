# Environment File Protection System

This system prevents corruption of critical `.env` files that caused connection issues.

## Available Commands

### `npm run protect-env`
- ✅ Validates `.env` file structure
- 📁 Creates timestamped backups
- 🔄 Auto-restores from backup if corrupted
- 🧹 Cleans old backups (keeps last 5)

### `npm run restore-env`
- 🚨 Emergency restore of `.env` file
- ⚡ Recreates file with correct credentials
- 🔧 Use if `.env` gets completely corrupted

## Automatic Protection

### Git Hooks
- **Pre-commit**: Prevents committing `.env` files
- **Validation**: Checks file integrity before commits

### File Backups
- Automatic timestamped backups: `.env.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- Main backup: `.env.backup`
- All backups are gitignored

## Usage

### Daily Development
```bash
# Before important work
npm run protect-env

# If connection issues appear
npm run restore-env
```

### If `.env` Gets Corrupted Again
1. Run `npm run restore-env`
2. Restart dev server: `npm start`
3. Check browser console for connection success

## File Structure
- `.env` - Main environment file (protected)
- `.env.backup` - Manual backup
- `.env.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` - Timestamped backups
- `scripts/protect-env.ps1` - Protection script
- `scripts/restore-env.ps1` - Emergency restore script

## What Caused the Original Issue
- Environment variables on single line without line breaks
- React couldn't parse the malformed file
- Supabase client received `undefined` values
- Connection timeouts resulted

This system prevents that from happening again! 🛡️
