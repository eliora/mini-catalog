1) catalog:
    image exist in db, if click it open, but not seen without click, also pic is big and sometimes low res is needed. think of how to show it without need to upload all pics everytime
    in non-mobile view like desktop size is on the right of the name, not good. make it look like in mobile. size on the left
    make it possible to edit qty with typing in keyboard.
2) order form:
i dont like layout follow mui for order summary practices.
add missing client name field.
print/save button make it not good lookin, bad layout, make it look nice.
order number looks un professional, like a token then a typical orde number.
